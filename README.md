## A funny Story

So one day , one of you cat when out and went on a hunt.
She cames back with a rat (or a mouse I don't remember)
But it was still alive :') .
Another time we didn't saw her coming home with a little present . 
We only find out later in the evening when our 3 cats were player with the mouse :') 

### TL;DR
Don't trust your cat with their present :')
